Q1. Scenario: A company wants to analyze the sales performance of its products in different regions. They have collected the following data:
   Region A: [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
   Region B: [18, 20, 16, 22, 25]
   Calculate the mean sales for each region.
     
SOLUTION:

Region A:
Sales = [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
Number of data points = 5

Mean Sales for Region A = (10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 14) / 5 = 11.8

Region B:
Sales = [18, 20, 16, 22, 25]
Number of data points = 5

Mean Sales for Region B = (18 + 20 + 16 + 22 + 25) / 5 = 20.2

So, the mean sales for Region A is 11.8 and the mean sales for Region B is 20.2.

3. Scenario: A company wants to compare the salaries of two departments. The salary data for Department A and Department B are as follows:
   Department A: [5000, 6000, 5500, 7000]
   Department B: [4500, 5500, 5800, 6000, 5200]
   Calculate the median salary for each department.

     SOLUTION:


Step 1: Sort the salary data in ascending order:
Department A: [5000, 5500, 6000, 7000]
Department B: [4500, 5200, 5500, 5800, 6000]

Step 2: Calculate the median:
For an odd number of data points, the median is the middle value.
For an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.

Department A:
- Number of data points: 4 (even)
- Middle values: 5500 and 6000
- Median: (5500 + 6000) / 2 = 5750

Department B:
- Number of data points: 5 (odd)
- Middle value: 5500
- Median: 5500

The median salary for Department A is 5750, and for Department B is 5500.

4. Scenario: A data analyst wants to determine the variability in the daily stock prices of a company. The data collected is as follows:
   [25.5, 24.8, 26.1, 25.3, 24.9]
   Calculate the range of the stock prices.
SOLUTION:

Step 1: Sort the data in ascending order:
Sorted Data: [24.8, 24.9, 25.3, 25.5, 26.1]

Step 2: Calculate the range:
Range = Highest Value - Lowest Value

Highest Value = 26.1
Lowest Value = 24.8

Range = 26.1 - 24.8 = 1.3

The range of the stock prices is 1.3.

5. Scenario: A study is conducted to compare the performance of two different teaching methods. The test scores of the students in each group are as follows:
   Group A: [85, 90, 92, 88, 91]
   Group B: [82, 88, 90, 86, 87]
   Perform a t-test to determine if there is a significant difference in the mean scores between the two groups

6. Scenario: A company wants to analyze the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales. The data collected is as follows:
   Advertising Expenditure (in thousands): [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]
   Sales (in thousands): [25, 30, 28, 20, 26]
   Calculate the correlation coefficient between advertising expenditure and sales.

SOLUTION:

1. Calculate the mean of advertising expenditure:
   X̄ = (10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 14) / 5

2. Calculate the mean of sales:
   Ȳ = (25 + 30 + 28 + 20 + 26) / 5

3. Calculate the deviations of advertising expenditure:
   Deviation of Xi = Xi - X̄

   Deviations: [-2, 3, 0, -4, 2]

4. Calculate the deviations of sales:
   Deviation of Yi = Yi - Ȳ

   Deviations: [-1.6, 3.4, 1.4, -6.6, -0.6]

5. Calculate the product of deviations for each pair of values:

   Products of Deviations: [-3.2, 10.2, 0, 26.4, -1.2]

6. Calculate the sum of the products of deviations:
   Σ((Xi - X̄) * (Yi - Ȳ)) = -3.2 + 10.2 + 0 + 26.4 + (-1.2)

7. Calculate the standard deviation of advertising expenditure (Sx).

8. Calculate the standard deviation of sales (Sy).

9. Calculate the correlation coefficient (r) using the formula:
   r = (Sum of Products of Deviations) / (Sx * Sy)

8. Scenario: A company wants to analyze the relationship between employee tenure and job satisfaction. The data collected is as follows:
   Employee Tenure (in years): [2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 4]
   Job Satisfaction (on a scale of 1 to 10): [7, 8, 6, 9, 5, 7, 6]
   Perform a linear regression analysis to predict job satisfaction based on employee tenure.

  SOLUTION:


1. Prepare the data: Organize the employee tenure values as the independent variable (X) and the job satisfaction values as the dependent variable (Y).

   Employee Tenure (X): [2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 2, 4]
   Job Satisfaction (Y): [7, 8, 6, 9, 5, 7, 6]

2. Calculate the mean of X and Y.

   X̄ = (2 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 4) / 7
   Ȳ = (7 + 8 + 6 + 9 + 5 + 7 + 6) / 7

3. Calculate the deviations of X and Y from their respective means.

   Deviations of X (Xi - X̄): [-0.86, 0.14, 2.14, 1.14, 3.14, -0.86, 1.14]
   Deviations of Y (Yi - Ȳ): [-0.86, 0.14, -1.86, 1.14, -2.86, -0.86, -1.86]

4. Calculate the product of the deviations of X and Y.

   Product of Deviations (Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ): [0.7436, -0.0124, -3.9844, 1.2964, -8.9584, 0.7436, -2.9584]

5. Calculate the squared deviations of X.

   Squared Deviations of X (Xi - X̄)²: [0.7396, 0.0144, 4.5796, 1.2996, 9.8596, 0.7396, 1.2996]

6. Calculate the sum of the product of deviations and squared deviations of X.

   Sum of Product of Deviations and Squared Deviations = Σ[(Xi - X̄)(Yi - Ȳ)] = 0.7436 + (-0.0124) + (-3.9844) + 1.2964 + (-8.9584) + 0.7436 + (-2.9584) = -12.8308

   Sum of Squared Deviations of X = Σ(Xi - X̄)² = 0.7396 + 0.0144 + 4.5796 + 1.2996 + 9.8596 + 0.7396 + 1.2996 = 18.5316

7. Calculate the slope (β1) of the linear regression line.

   β1 = Sum of Product of Deviations and Squared Deviations / Sum of Squared Deviations of X = -12.8308 / 18.5316

8. Calculate the intercept (β0) of the linear regression line.

   β0 = Ȳ - β1 * X̄

9. Write the linear regression equation.

   Job Satisfaction (Y) = β0 + β1 * Employee Tenure (X)
